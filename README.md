## Goal
Create a start-up comprising of a team of 7 students to develop a web-based service for allowing SFSU students and faculty to buy, sell and rent the local housing close to SFSU. 
## Requirements
This site is to be set such that anybody can post housing for sale or rent (houses, apartments) but actual renting and buying can only be done by SFSU students and faculty. 

Functions envisioned include: 

a) allow anybody to post hosing for rent or sale and to get messages only from SFSU students or faculty; 

b) allow any user to search and browse items for sale/share but only SFSU faculty or students to contact the seller via messaging; 

c) The site will also have administrator who will be required to approve each media item before it can go live, as well as to delete inappropriate items or users. Other functions may be added by student teams.
